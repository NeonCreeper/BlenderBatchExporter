# BlenderBatchExporter
A Blender Add-on that exports a batch file that renders the scene as an animation using the CMD

To use, just install the .py file as an addon. Once installed, press space in the view port and search for the addon, then click the 
relevant result to execute the script. The batch file will be output in the same location as the blend file you're working on.
At the moment, you have to run Blender with admin permissions for it to be able to save the file. Currently Windows and Blender 2.79 only.
